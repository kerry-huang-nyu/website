Personal Website built by cursor 

"Work smarter not smarter. But also I can't build websites and I have accepted that." 

So this is what I plan to do. 

DOM:
1. About me page that links to github, linkedin, and my email, my resume 
2. Page for GLASS 
3. Page for books I have read or are currently reading 
4. Page for projects. One link for every project that I have on github
